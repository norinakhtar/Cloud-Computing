COLLABORATIVE FILTERING:
Collaborative filtering is commonly used for recommender systems. These techniques aim to fill in the missing entries of a user-item association matrix.
spark.mllib currently supports model-based collaborative filtering, in which users and products are described by a small set of latent factors that can
be used to predict missing entries. spark.mllib uses the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm to learn these latent factors.
